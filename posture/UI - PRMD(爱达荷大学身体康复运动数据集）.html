	<p> <strong> Welcome to the UI-PRMD Web Site</strong></p>
	<p class="text"> &nbsp;UI-PRMD is a data set of movements related to common exercises performed by patients in physical 
	therapy and rehabilitation programs. 
	The data set is released under the Open Data Commons Public Domain Dedication and License <a href="http://opendatacommons.org/%20licenses/pddl/1.0">(PDDL) v1.0</a>, 
	and as such is publically available for free to all interested users.</p>
	<p class="text"> The movement data was collected in the 
	<a href="http://www.uidaho.edu/ed/mvsc/academics/at/spaces/lab">Integrated Sports Medicine Movement Analysis Laboratory</a> (ISMMAL) with the
	<a href="http://www.uidaho.edu/ed/mvsc">Department of Movement Sciences</a> at the 
	<a href="http://www.uidaho.edu/">University of Idaho</a>.&nbsp; </p>
	<p class="text"> The data set consists of 10 rehabilitation movements. A sample of 10 healthy individuals repeated each movement 10 times in front of two sensory systems for motion capturing: a Vicon optical tracker, and a Kinect camera. 
	The data is presented as positions and angles of the body joints in the 
	skeletal models provided by the Vicon and Kinect mocap systems. </p>
	<p><strong>Movements</strong></p>
	<p class="text"> The following 10 movements were selected for the data set: 
	(1) deep squat, (2) hurdle step, (3) inline lunge, (4) side lunge, (5) sit to stand, 
	(6) standing active straight leg raise, (7) standing shoulder abduction,	
	(8) standing shoulder extension, (9) standing shoulder internal-external rotation, 
	and (10) standing shoulder scaption.

	<p><strong>Data Description</strong></p>
	<p class="text"> The data is organized into two folders ‘Vicon’ and ‘Kinect’, each containing the measurements acquired by either of the two respective sensory systems. Each folder contains two subfolders, ‘Positions’ and ‘Angles,’ which 
	include the files with the respective values for the joint displacements.</p>
	<p class="text"> The nomenclature of the files in the data set includes the following information: movement number_subject number_positions/angles. For example, the data instance ‘m04_s06_angles’ pertains to the 4<sup>th</sup> movement (i.e., side lunge) performed by the 6<sup>th</sup> subject, and it consists of the angular displacements of the joints expressed in degrees. Similarly, ‘m08_s02_positions’ corresponds to the recorded Cartesian position coordinates for the 2<sup>nd</sup> subject while performing the standing 
		shoulder extension movement expressed in millimeters. </p>
	<p class="text"> Further, because each movement consists of 10 episodes, or repetitions, the data is also provided in a segmented form, where each file comprises the measurements for one episode of one of the 
		movements. The corresponding data is provided in the 'Segmented Movements' folder. The following file nomenclature is used for the segmented movements: movement number_subject number_episode number_positions/angles. In this case, the file ‘m04_s06_e10_angles’ consists of the angular joint measurements for the 10<sup>th</sup> episode of the 4<sup>th</sup> movement performed by the 6<sup>th</sup> subject.</p>
	<p class="text"> In addition, the data set provides examples of the movements performed in an incorrect manner. The rationale for it is that patients with musculoskeletal injury or constraints are assumed to be unable 
	to, at least initially, perform the prescribed therapy movements in a correct or optimal way during a physical therapy exercise. This portion of the data can serve as a testing set, and it can be used for validation of derived mathematical models for the above described movements. In creating the set of incorrect movements, all of the subjects performed 10 episodes of the 10 movements arbitrarily in a suboptimal manner. 
	The file nomenclature for the incorrect movements follows the same order as for the correct movements, and in addition, all files have an extension _inc, which implies ‘incorrect’. For instance, the file ‘m05_s04_e03_angles_inc’ corresponds to the incorrect 3<sup>rd</sup> episode performed by the 4<sup>th</sup> subject for the sit to stand movement. </p>
	<p class="text"> Description of the joints order for the Vicon and Kinect sensors in the data files, as well as additional description of the position and angular measurements can be found in the paper listed below in the 	<a href="https://webpages.uidaho.edu/ui-prmd/#Citation">Citation</a> section.</p>
	<p class="text"> The data is presented in ASCII txt format, with comma delimiter used for separating the data values in the files.</p>

	<p><strong>Missing Data</strong></p>
	<p class="text"> The files 'm03_s03_positions/angles' for the Vicon system, related to the inline lunge movement performed by the 3<sup>rd</sup> subject, are missing. The corresponding data for the same movement recorded with the Kinect sensor is available in the data set.</p>
	<p><strong>Code for Data Visualization</strong> (<a href="https://webpages.uidaho.edu/ui-prmd/UI-PRMD%20Visualize.zip">link</a>)</p>
	<p class="text"> The code is written in MATLAB and provides 
	visualization of the movement data acquired with the Kinect v2 sensor by using Brekel Pro Body v2 software.</p>

	<p><strong>Reduced Data Set</strong></p>
	<p class="text">In our recent study titled <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.10435">A Deep Learning Framework for Assessing Physical Rehabilitation Exercises</a> 
	we used a reduced version of the original data set, consisting only of 
	segmented angular displacements of the body joints collected with the Vicon 
	motion capture system. In the reduced data set, the episodes of the 
	movements that are not consistent (e.g., the subject used different arm/leg 
	than the other subjects, missing measurement data, movements deviate significantly from the rest of the movements,&nbsp; etc.) have been removed. 
	 The reduced data set can be downloaded from <a href="https://webpages.uidaho.edu/ui-prmd/Reduced%20Data.zip">here</a> (174 MB).
